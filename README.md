# HTML-Examples
Here is an example of a project that used HTML. For me personally I prefer to use an Editor called Visual Studio Code. 
Here is an example of HTML usage using different tags that were talked about previously.

This uses an example of using 2 different types of bullet points along with using the style method of changing the color of the font. It also includes the tags of using underline the text and a line going through the text as well.

Here is the link of a project of mine that had been created using Visual Studio Code as the HTML Editor to create this file.

From this line, the code used here is actually HTML. Github uses it as an editor as well. the only code that actually shows is the begining and that is because it details how the website would look like in color.
